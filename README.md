# BALB - A Bayesian approximate likelihood-based estimation method

### Brief description
STAN and R codes for inferring multiple-type pathogen interactions from longitudial data. The code was used to estimate the interaction parameters in the multi-state models proposed in "Approximate likelihood-based estimation method of multiple-type
pathogen interactions: an application to longitudinal pneumococcal carriage data", *Journal, year (doi: )*.

### Prerequisites
